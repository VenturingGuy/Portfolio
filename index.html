		<p>
			Hello! I'm Luis Ventura. I'm a junior at Make School, with a background at Cerritos College.
			Growing up, I was constantly moving from home to home with my family, so I found it difficult to make friends.
			Eventually, I got a computer, and it became my inspiration, my friend, a teacher, and more, all in one.
			Ever since, I've always wanted to learn more about how they work and how I can get them to work.
			Even today, they're still a part of who I am now. I enjoy composing music in my free time, and I stream 
			video games on Twitch for about 4 hours a day when possible.
